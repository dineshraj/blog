![tagliatelle][intro]

Cooking pasta in the sauce you intend to serve it with will change how you make pasta. The pasta will be properly infused with the sauce as the starch from the pasta will make it stick, and also thicken the sauce and make it rich. Also it is quicker and results in less washing, so let's get cooking!

* Bring to the boil and then reduce to a simmer.

* Stir well and cover the pan with the lid, cook for roughly 10 mins (until the pasta is done), and stir regularly to prevent sticking.

* Stir in the chopped basil, some pepper and salt to taste and then serve.

* Optionally sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top.

* Enjoy!
