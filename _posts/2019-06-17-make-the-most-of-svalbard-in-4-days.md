![Welcome to the Arctic Circle][intro]


* Ever wanted to go to the arctic circle? It's easy, if you don't believe me, check out [this video from Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFJ-ze2-SqU) on how to visit Svalbard. 

Basically you have to go via Norway, more specifically Oslo. 

Despite the sound the name "arctic circle", it's not as remote or as sparsely populated as you might think. It's not just a bunch of research stations but has a proper (though very small) city called longyearbyern, which was settled when mining was a big source of income in the area. 

Aroudn 2000 people live there and it is becoming a more popular tourist destination, so they have some bars that wouldnt look out of place in Shoreditch, London and AirBnBs and fast wifi (mainly beacuse of the research also done there).

Speaking AirBnBs, I'd recommend these, there are a few hotel but they'd be a lot more expensive. 

Prepare for weather! This article is from a June holiday, so around the city itself there isn't much snow, but as soon as you leave the time you have endless slow and glaciers so wrap up warm. Also in June is it part of their "summer sun" season where the sun stays high in the sky for 24 hours a day, which can be disorienting, so make sure you try and sleep at a regular-ish time (the bars close at 2am so there's not much to do after this anyway).

Also alcohol. There is one shop in the city center that sells alcohol and you have to show your boarding pass each time you want to buy any. There is a limit too (even for residents), due to the extreme weather fucking with your head. 

If you're worried about polar bears dont be, they are very rarely seen near the city, but if you go out of town you are require by law to carry a weapon, so only go with guides or residents. 

As for the activities below, you'll want to book them well in advance, [Visit Svalbard](https://en.visitsvalbard.com/) is recommended as a one-stop place to book everything you need.

## Day One

This article assumes you've just landed 
You'll arrive at a tiny airport, aptly named Svalbard Airport, and will have to get a coach to the city center, take a look around, for most people you wont have been to the artic cirle before so take it all you can. you're in the northernmost capital of the world! Take note of the huge metal polar bear statue as you get off the coach.

if check in is open, go and check into your hotel or airbnb and then you're ready to start your adventure! 

First up is husky sledding, which is an amazing experience. 
go by car to the area and get given a warm boiler suit and a hi-vis jacket to wear, then you get to go in the kennels where you get to go into the enclosure and have a play with teh huskeys, who are all super friendly and very energetic. 

after a while the handler a will pick out a few dogs and then you get the surprisingly hard task of harnessing them. THey are super energetic, especailly now they are out of the enclosure and can see the vast plains of the snow - they know what's about to happen and they can't wait! 

After that is all successfully (or with help) done, they are tied to the sleds, 6 per sled and you get to learn some basic sled controls, mainly breaking and also a jagged metal thing you can throw down for extra friction agains the snow.

But even with those you have to keep a lot of weight on the breaks and the huskys are strong!

You'll also take it in turns to
