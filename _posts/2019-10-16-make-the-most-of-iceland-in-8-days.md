**How can you best spend 8 days travelling around Iceland, and why is this a recommended length for a trip to this beautiful island? Read on to see how to spend 8 amazing days in Iceland.**

You've probably arrived at Keflavík International Airport, taken the shuttle bus to pick up your car and
are itching with excitement to explore this beautiful island! 

The article starts you off just leaving the capital, Reykjavik (don't worry, you'll spend some time there at the end!)
and points out some of the best things to see and some great places to stay too. 

Don't stick to just these places though, there's so much that this trip didn't contain, and also take lots of unscheduled stops and the various laybys on the ring road, there is so much beautiful scenery between these places so don't miss out on those!

*Note: Most guides will tell you to visit the Blue Lagoon first but due to a delayed flight, that didn't happen on this trip. I hear it's beautiful but very expensive).*

This trip was done in early October and mostly utilises the main ring road to get around.

This article will start with a overview and then it'll go into more detail. Ok, let's get started!

***Note on the weather**: Unfortunately the weather was not ideal during the entire duration of the trip, and apart from a couple of days, it was constantly cloudy and rainy, with not a clear night whatsoever. This meant I did not see any stars or the nothern lights, whether this is typical for October or not, I'm not sure.*

## Day One
### Reykjavik to Hvolsvöllur

![alt text][seljalandsfoss]

**Things to see**
 - Þingvellir National Park
 - Almannagjá Rift
 - Haukadalur Geothermal Valley
 - Seljalandsfoss
 - Skógafoss

 **Where to stay**
 - Guesthouse Rauðafell, Hvolsvöllur (via AirBnB)
  
First up is **Þingvellir National Park** which a moss blanketed area in between the North American plate and Eurasian tectonic plates. 

The area is 7km wide and it grows a bit each year as the plates slowly move apart. Iceland is technically getting bigger! It, however, sinks roughly 2cm a year due to this.

The rift is also featured in Games of Thrones. It is the location of the Bloody Gate, leading up to The Eyrie where the Hound takes Arya Stark to be reunited with her aunt.

Take the time to walk around a bit here, you can walk along the rift to **Öxarárfoss** waterfall too.

Next up is the **Haukadalur Geothermal Valley**. which contains two main geysers. The Great Geysir, which has been dormant for years and rarely erupts, and neighbouring Strokkur, which erupts every 5 minutes or so and sends boiling water and steam upwards up to 30 metres. This area is home to the first geyser known to Europe.

{% include video.html video='/assets/iceland/strokkur.mp4' caption='Strokkur erupting at Haukadalur Geothermal Valley' %}

You have two more waterfalls left today. The first is the beautiful **Seljalandsfoss**, which sees glacial water falling over an indented cliff which has a large cavern carved out behind it. The cavern lets you walk behind and around it and it is an amazing experience, allowing you take in the waterfall and it's power right up close.

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/seljalandfoss.jpg' caption='Seljalandfoss Waterfall' %}  

Next up on the route is **Skógafoss**, which is a powerful waterfall with a viewing platform to the side. It's an impressive 25 meters wide and 60 meters tall.

If you've taken your time seeing all the beautiful sites, light is probably fading by now, but there is a Bistro Bar nearby Skógafoss and the recommended **Guesthouse Rauðafell** is just a short drive away in **Hvolsvöllur**. The guest house is large modern and spotless and has 6 rooms for guests. There is also a breakfast provided in the morning.

## Day Two
### Hvolsvöllur to Hofn

![alt text][reynisfjara]

**Things to see**
 - Dyrhólaey
 - Reynisfjara
 - Skaftareldahraun
 - Pjadrurfoss
 - Vatnajökull
 - Skaftafell
 - Diamond Beach 

 **Where to stay**
 - Höfn í Hornafirði, Höfn (AirBnB)

After what will be a lovely breakfast, set out for **Dyrhólaey**, which is a mountain peninsula on a cliff with some staggering views. There is an impressive looking rock arch standing strong in the sea and a black beach down below. In the summer you can see puffins here. 

There is a plane wreck on the route before Dyrhólaey called **DC-3 Plane Wreckage**, which crashed in 1973. The fusalage was abandoned there afterwards. It's a 4km hike over very dull black sand terrain (or you can take a expensive shuttle bus), so I didn't venture out to see it, but it could be a good photo opportunity.

The next stop is **Reynisfjara**, near the town of Vik. Stop here for a while an appreciate the black sand, the crashing waves and the basalt columns and rock formations. It's a truly spectacular place and if you're a city dweller it's a great chance to unwind and feel relaxed. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/reynisfjara.jpg' caption='Reynisfjara Beach' %}

After taking it the atmosphere of Reynisfjara, you'll drive to Vatnajökull National park which as some great hiking routes and a tour up the biggset glacier in Iceland. 

However before that you'll go through the **Skaftareldahraun moss lava fields**, there isn't too much to see here but the bleak desolate landscape can really strike home - there is ancient black lava covered in moss as far as the eye can see. 

There are also some great stops along the way, the main one of note is **Pjadrurfoss waterfall**. It's a small waterfall but the setting and the several streams of water all frothing and flowing into the main river is magnificent. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/pjadrurfoss.jpg' caption='Pjadrurfoss Waterfall' %}

The main attraction of the afternoon is **Vatnajökull National Park**, which is named after the biggest glacier in Iceland. It's about the size of Cyprus and  and the national park has guided tours up the glacier. You can't go on your own so you'll need a guide, which will supply the correct equipment to walk up this magnificent glacier. 

If you fancy something a bit more low-key, there are great hiking trails around the **Skaftafell** area of the national park, and you are also only about a 20 minute walk from a magnificent lake near Vatnajökull glacier, which has small icebergs floating in it, making for some fantastic scenery. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/vatnajokull.jpg' caption='Vatnajökull National Park' %}

Once you've had your fill of the Vatnajökull National Park, hopefully you have enough day light to admire the **Diamond Beach** (I didn't unfortunately!). It's an incredibly picturesque beach where the icebergs of Jökulsárlón wash up on their journey out to the Atlantic Ocean, giving a stark contrast to the jet black sand. 

A short drive later and you'll make it to the small fishing village of Hofn to your accomodation. 

## Day Three

### Hofn to Egilsstaðir

![alt text][stokksnes]

**Things to see**
 - Hoffell hot tubs
 - Stokksnes Mountain
 - The Viking Village
 - Lagarfljót

 **Where to stay**
 - Tehúsið Hostel, Egilsstaðir (AirBnB)

Good morning! Hope you had a good sleep because you have a busy day ahead of  you. First up is the **Hoffell Hot Tubs**. Now, just to manage your expectations here, don't expect Blue Lagoon style luxury, these are hot tubs that it feels like locals would use, but the facilities are clean, it's very cheap and it is set in a beautiful location. 

There are about 5 hot hubs, all geothermally heated and changing rooms, an outdoor shower and towels are provided. It's definitely worth a visit. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/hoffell-hot-tub.jpg' caption='Hoffell Hot Tubs' %}

Next up is a drive to the **Stokksnes mountain** area, which is a beautiful area on a peninsula. You'll have to pay a little in the Viking Cafe to get through the barriers and to the car park but once you do, you can wonder around a very picturesque area with the mountain looming over another black beach. 

A little walk inland you'll come to the **Viking Village**, which is a intricate and accurately build viking village for a TV series that never made it to air. The remains of the village are still here and it really is an experience to wonder around and feel how vikings could have once lived. You may notice the strange remains of a fake rock wall near the center of the village, this was to hide a stone building from view. The stairs are still accessible from the back so go ahead, climb them and explore! 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/viking-village.jpg' caption='Viking Village' %}

There is quite a long drive to Egilsstaðir, the largest city in the East, but on the way you'll come across **Lagarfljót**, which is a large lake. According to legend the lake is said to hold the cousin of the Loch Ness monster, the Lagarfljót Wyrm. Sightings to back to 1345, so see if you can spot it. 

From here you'll be pretty close to **Egilsstaðir**, the Capital of the East. You'll be staying at **Tehúsið Hostel**, which is a great hostel with a bar (happy hour til 7pm!), games and a great chill out area. It's also worth a wonder into town too to check out the Askur Taproom, which has a wide range of craft beers and karaoke. This bar wouldn't be out of place in Shoreditch, London! 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/tehusid-hostel.jpg' caption='Tehusid Hostel' %}

## Day Four

![alt text][dettifoss]

### Egilsstaðir to Husavik

**Things to see**
 - Seyðisfjörður
 - Dettifoss
 - Krafla
 - Námaskarð

 **Where to stay**
 - Fosshotel, Húsavík (Booking.com)

You're going to be very busy today as there are so many amazing things to see, but before we get onto the powerful aspects of nature on show here, let's take a trip to **Seyðisfjörður**, which is a small fishing village right out on the east coast. It is embraced by mountains and has a natural port. It's also a great place to grab some breakfast before heading out. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/seydisfjordur.jpg' caption='Seyðisfjörður Fishing Village' %}

Hope you got a nice breakfast, because now you're going to Europe's largest and most powerful waterfall, **Dettifoss**. As with most natural attractions in Iceland, there are no barriers or walkways, apart from some sparsely hammered in posts, so you're free to explore and experience Dettifoss' power right up close. Take your time here, it is truly a magnificent experience to be right up close to that much power. 

{% include video.html video='/assets/iceland/dettifoss.mp4' caption='Dettifoss Waterfall' %}

The next stop is **Krafla**, which is an active volcano. It currently has a big lake in it as it hasn't erupted since 1984 but there have been 29 reported eruptions in recorded history. 

After this drive down to **Námaskarð**, which is an amazing geothermal area where the ground is literally steaming everywhere. It really does look and feel (and smells!) like another planet due to the sulphur deposits and the vents with constant billowing steam coming out of the ground. 

{% include video.html video='/assets/iceland/namaskard.mp4' caption='Namaskard Thermal area' %}

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/namaskard.jpg' caption='Namaskard Thermal area' %}

There's lots more to see around here, like Mývatn lake and Ásbyrgi canyon, and also a couple more, but you can save that for tomorrow afternoon.

You'll now drive to Husavik, where a meal out may be in order. Try [Naustið](https://www.facebook.com/naustid), which serves traditional Icelandic food at reasonable prices. The fish mash is recommended.

Your stay tonight is in an actual hotel, Fosshotel, the perfect location for your whale watching tomorrow! 

## Day Five

![alt text][grjotagja]

### Husavik to Akureyri

**Things to see**
 - Húsavík (book whale watching in advance)
 - Mývatn Nature Baths
 - Grjótagjá Cave
 - Goðafoss waterfall
 
 **Where to stay**
 - Apotek Guesthouse, Akureyri (Booking.com)

 Hopefully you enjoyed your hotel last night and you're up early because it's time for **whale watching**. I booked with North Sailing but there are a few companies around the area offering different types of boats, so do some research before you book. 
 
 You'll go down to the harbour, show your e-ticket for a real ticket and then board one of the nearby boats. You'll get given some nice warm outer clothes and be on your way. 

 The tour is around 3 hours and takes you north of Iceland. Hopefully you'll see some humpback whales, which are quite common to the area, but the experience of being on a boat in the North Atlantic is also a great one. 

 *Note: the best time for whales is in the summer, and as I went in October, I didn't see any, but I was granted a free tour again at any point in the future*

 {% include video.html video='/assets/iceland/whale-watching.mp4' caption='Whale watching in Husavik' %}

Hopefully you saw some whales, but now take the time to walk around Husavik a bit, it's got some nice shops and a few bars and restaurants. 

Now you're going to head back to Mývatn to see some of the things you didn't see yesterday. First is the **Mývatn Nature Baths**, which, like the Blue Lagoon, is a very popular but expensive thermal pool. 

Next up is the **Grjótagjá Cave**, which is featured in Games of Thrones when Jon Snow proved he *does* in fact know something with Ygritte. It looks smaller in real life than it does in Game of Thrones but it's still cool to see. Unfortunately you can't bathe in here as due to eruptions from 1975 - 1984, the temperature rose to over 50 degrees celsius. 

The surrounding landscape is beautiful, and you can see how the earth was ripped open by an incredible force.

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/grjotagja.jpg' caption='Grjotagja Landscape' %}

The last stop before the fair drive to Akureyri is **Goðafoss waterfall**, which is another one of Iceland's stunning waterfalls. It streams down in an arc shape, making it really wide and it's power is a sight to behold. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/godafoss.jpg' caption='Godafoss Waterfall' %}

Now you'll drive west to the Northern Capital, Akureyri and to the **Apotek Guesthouse**. If you have some time, take a look around the city, there are some great bars and restaurants, and a great bar in the Akureyri Backpackers hostel just down the road from the Apotek Guesthouse with nice atmosphere and some board games. Also check out any fish and chip restaurants around here, the fish is caught nearby so it tastes amazing. 

##  Day Six

![alt text][thingeyrarkirkja]

### Akureyri to Hellissandur

**Things to see**
 - Akureyri old town
 - Sundlaug thermal baths
 - Þingeyrarkirkja
 
 **Where to stay**
 - West Park Guesthouse , Hellissandur (AirBnB)

 *Note: This was a very very driving heavy day as when driving from Akureyri to Hellissandur (which is already a 5 hour drive), Google Maps decided to change our route, for reasons unknown, and take us all the way near Hólmavik and then back down again, so keep an eye on your route.* 

This morning you'll go and wonder around the **Akureyri old town**, which is full of older wooden buildngs and a very striking church. Aim to have a chilled out morning here and grab some lunch later on, as there will be a lot of driving coming up in the latter part of the day. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/akureyrarkirkja.jpg' caption='Akureyrarkirkja Church' %}

Nearby, the **Sundlaug thermal baths** are a great place to relax. They are public geothermal baths with several pools of different temperatures, a swimming pool, a sauna and some water slides. This is a place that locals frequent, so it is not full of tourists as other places may be. 

When you're satisfied you've seen enough of Akureyri, it's time to begin your drive west. It's a long drive but there are things to see on the way so make sure you leave enough day light to see them all. 

The drive itself goes through many different types of terrain, but nothing too extremely so a front wheel drive car is fine. You'll drive up a mountain, some gravel and dirt roads and some newly laid tarmac too. Depending on the time of year you're going to may also see some snow, if you haven't already, as you drive up a mountain.

{% include video.html video='/assets/iceland/snowy-drive.mp4' caption='Driving though the snow' %}

The roads are also marked with wooden poles with reflective patches on them to guide you when it gets dark, but don't expect any street lights. You'll find driving in the dark near the coast, with the invisible waves crashing to the right of you, an experience that'll stay with you. 

One stop of note is one of Icelands only stone churches called **Þingeyrarkirkja**, which is worth a stop. Other points of note include Hvitserkur (a 15m basalt stack), Eiriksstadir (ancient viking ruins), Stykkishólmur (harbour town and lighthouse) and Djúpalónssandur (a black beach).  

After the drive you'll arrive at Hellissandur, where **West Park Guesthouse** is located nearby.

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/west-park.jpg' caption='West Park Guesthouse' %}


## Day Seven

![alt text][snaefellsnes]

### Hellissandur to Reykjavík

**Things to see**
 - Snæfellsnes,
 - Vatnshellir Cave
 - Hellnar
 - Arnarstapi
 
 **Where to stay**
 - Central Reykjavík (AirBnB)

Welcome to Day 7, hopefully you've rested up nicely from the long drive over to the West Park Guesthouse and are ready for another day of exploring. 

The guesthouse is actually in **Snæfellsnes National Park** so there are some beautiful dramatic landscapes, and at its western tip, Snæfellsjökull Volcano, which is topped by a glacier. There are also lava fields and the Stykkishólmur fishing village to explore. 

Next up is Vatnshellir Cave. This is an 8000 year old lava cave and is only accessible via a guided tour, which leaves relatively frequently throughout the day. The view around here is also spectacular, with moss lava fields stretching off into the distance and the shore just nearby with basalt columns rising tall on the shoreline and a picturesque lighthouse.

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/snaefellsnes.jpg' caption='Snæfellsnes National Park' %}

A short drive away now is **Hellnar**, a small cliffisde town, with some lovely paths to walk through and a cove near the shore. There is also a lovely looking corrugated iron church standing tall on a hill here. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/hellnar.jpg' caption='Hellnar Church' %}

Another small cliffside village in this area is **Arnarstapi**, which has adopted a stone sculpture, Bárður Snæfellsás, as its symbol. You can hike there from Hellnar, which is roughly 1 hour, or it's roughly a 10 minute drive. There are amazing cliffside views here from the viewing point, as well as a few bars and restaurants. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/arnarstapi.jpg' caption='Arnarstapi' %}

There are plenty of other things to see in this area too, such as Hraunfossar and Barnafossar waterfalls, Deildartunguhver (Europe's most powerful hot spring), and if you're more adventurous, you can go caving in Víðgelmir, Iceland's largest lava caves.

When you are satisfied you've explored this area to your liking, drive down towards Reykjavík, where hopefully you have a nice AirBnB room waiting for you. 

## Day Eight

![alt text][sun-voyager]

### Reykjavík

**Things to see**
 - Reykjavík city
 - Sun Voyager
 - Hallgrimskirkja
 
 **Where to stay**
 - Central Reykjavík (AirBnB)

Today is your chance to explore the lovely city of Reykjavík. There is lots to do here, and from your past week, being in a city may be something of a culture shock. 

The **Sun Voyager** sculpture, which is a cross between a ship and a scorpion is definitely one to see, and as it is on the coast, it's a great photo opportunity. Also the nearby Hallgrimskirkja church is magnificently imposing. 

You should also check out the bars in the area, **The Dubliner** is a good choice for some great atmosphere and liveliness, and the Irishman is more chilled out if you want a more quiet time. There are too many restaurants to list here but it's worth looking around and trying out whatever takes your fancy. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/reykjavik.jpg' caption='Icelandic parliamand' %}

If you want to reflect on your journey a bit, there is a huge model of Iceland in the tourist information centre, with light up sections denoting key parts of the island. 

But this is the last day of your trip so use it as you feel is best. You can even drive out to the Blue Lagoon or anywhere else you feel you would like to spend more time. 

Hopefully you've had an amazing time in Iceland. It's definitely a a trip you'll remember forever and a beautiful country to visit. Hopefully this guide has been some help to you too, thanks for reading!
