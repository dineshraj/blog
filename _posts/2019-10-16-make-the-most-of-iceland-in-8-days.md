**How can you best spend 8 days travelling around Iceland, and why is this a recommended length for a trip to this beautiful island? Read on to see how to spend 8 amazing days in Iceland.**

You've probably arrived at Keflavík International Airport, taken the shuttle bus to pick up your car and
are itching with excitement to explore this beautiful island! 

The article starts you off just leaving the capital, Reykjavik (don't worry, you'll spend some time there at the end!)
and point out some of the best things to see and some great places to stay too. 

Don't stick to just these places though, there's so much that this trip didn't contain, and also take lots of unscheduled stops and the various laybys on the ring road, there is so much beautiful scenery between these places so don't miss out on those!

*Note: Most guides will tell you to visit the Blue Lagoon first but due to a delayed flight, that didn't happen on this trip. I hear it's beautiful but very expensive).*

This trip was done in early October and mostly utilises the main ring road to get around.

This article will start with a overview and then it'll go into more detail. Ok, let's get started!

***Note on the weather**: Unfortunately the weather was not ideal during the entire duration of the trip, and apart from a couple of days, it was constantly cloudy and rainy, with not a clear night whatsoever. This meant I did not see any stars or the nothern lights, whether this is typical for October or not, I'm not sure.*

## Day 1
### Reykjavik to Hvolsvöllur

![alt text][seljalandsfoss]

**Things to see**
 - Þingvellir National Park
 - Almannagjá Rift
 - The Great Geysir
 - Seljalandsfoss
 - Skógafoss

 **Where to stay**
 - Guesthouse Rauðafell, Hvolsvöllur (via AirBnB)
  
  First up is **Þingvellir National Park** which contains the a rift between two tectonic plates, the North American plate and the Eurasian plate. 
  
  The rift itself is 7km wide and it grows a bit each year as the plates move apart, Iceland is technically getting bigger! It, however, sinks roughly 2cm a year due to this.

  The rift is also featured in Games of Thrones. It is the location of the Bloody Gate, leading up to The Eyrie where the Hound takes Arya Stark to be reunited with her aunt.

  Take the time to walk around a bit here, you can walk along the rift to **Öxarárfoss** waterfall too.

  Next up is the **Geysir geothermal area**. which contains two main geysers. The Great Geysir, which has been dormant for years and rarely erupts, and neighbouring Strokkur, which erupts every 5 minutes or so and sends boiling water and steam upwards up to 30 metres. This area is home to the first geyser known to Europe.

  You have two more waterfalls left today. The first is the beautiful **Seljalandsfoss**, which sees glacial water falling over an indented cliff which has a large cavern carved out behind it. The cavern lets you walk behind and around it and it is an amazing experience, allowing you take in the waterfall and it's power right up close.

  THere is a plane wreck on the route after Seljalandsfoss called **DC-3 Plane Wreckage**, which crashed in 1973. The fusalage was abandoned there afterwards. It's a 4km hike over very dull black sand terrain (or you can take a expensive shuttle bus), so we didn't venture out to see it, but it could be a good photo opportunity.

  Next up on the route is **Skógafoss**, which is a powerful waterfall with a viewing platform to the side. It's an impressive 25 meters wide and 60 meters tall.

  If you've taken your time seeing all the beautiful sites, light is probably fading by now, but there is a Bistro Bar nearby Skógafoss and the recommended **Guesthouse Rauðafell** is just a short drive away in **Hvolsvöllur**. The guest house is large, modern and spotless and has 6 rooms for guests. There is also a breakfast provided in the morning.

## Day 2
### Hvolsvöllur to Hofn

**Things to see**
 - Dyrhólaey
 - Reynisfjara
 - Pjadrurfoss
 - Vatnajökull
 - Skaftafell
 - Diamond Beach 

 **Where to stay**
 - Þórshamar, Höfn (AirBnB) (LOOK THIS UP)

After what will be a lovely breakfast, set out for **Dyrhólaey**, which is a mountain peninsula on a cliff with some staggering views. There is an impressive looking rock arch standing strong in the sea and a black beach down below. In the summer you can see puffins here. 

The next stop is **Reynisfjara**, near the town of Vik. Stop here for a while an appreciate the black sand, the crashing waves and the basalt columns and rock formations. It's a truly spectacular place and if you're a city dweller it's a great chance to unwind and feel relaxed.
