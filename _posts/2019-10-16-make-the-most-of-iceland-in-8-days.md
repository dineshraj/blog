**How can you best spend 8 days travelling around Iceland, and why is this a recommended length for a trip to this beautiful island? Read on to see how to spend 8 amazing days in Iceland.**

You've probably arrived at Keflavík International Airport, taken the shuttle bus to pick up your car and
are itching with excitement to explore this beautiful island! 

The article starts you off just leaving the capital, Reykjavik (don't worry, you'll spend some time there at the end!)
and point out some of the best things to see and some great places to stay too. 

Don't stick to just these places though, there's so much that this trip didn't contain, and also take lots of unscheduled stops and the various laybys on the ring road, there is so much beautiful scenery between these places so don't miss out on those!

*Note: Most guides will tell you to visit the Blue Lagoon first but due to a delayed flight, that didn't happen on this trip. I hear it's beautiful but very expensive).*

This trip was done in early October and mostly utilises the main ring road to get around.

This article will start with a overview and then it'll go into more detail. Ok, let's get started!

***Note on the weather**: Unfortunately the weather was not ideal during the entire duration of the trip, and apart from a couple of days, it was constantly cloudy and rainy, with not a clear night whatsoever. This meant I did not see any stars or the nothern lights, whether this is typical for October or not, I'm not sure.*

## Day 1
### Reykjavik to Hvolsvöllur

![alt text][seljalandsfoss]

**Things to see**
 - Þingvellir National Park
 - Almannagjá Rift
 - Haukadalur Geothermal Valley
 - Seljalandsfoss
 - Skógafoss

 **Where to stay**
 - Guesthouse Rauðafell, Hvolsvöllur (via AirBnB)
  
First up is **Þingvellir National Park** which a moss blanketed area in between the North American plate and Eurasian tectonic plates. 

The area is 7km wide and it grows a bit each year as the plates slowly move apart. Iceland is technically getting bigger! It, however, sinks roughly 2cm a year due to this.

The rift is also featured in Games of Thrones. It is the location of the Bloody Gate, leading up to The Eyrie where the Hound takes Arya Stark to be reunited with her aunt.

Take the time to walk around a bit here, you can walk along the rift to **Öxarárfoss** waterfall too.

Next up is the **Haukadalur Geothermal Valley**. which contains two main geysers. The Great Geysir, which has been dormant for years and rarely erupts, and neighbouring Strokkur, which erupts every 5 minutes or so and sends boiling water and steam upwards up to 30 metres. This area is home to the first geyser known to Europe.

You have two more waterfalls left today. The first is the beautiful **Seljalandsfoss**, which sees glacial water falling over an indented cliff which has a large cavern carved out behind it. The cavern lets you walk behind and around it and it is an amazing experience, allowing you take in the waterfall and it's power right up close.

Next up on the route is **Skógafoss**, which is a powerful waterfall with a viewing platform to the side. It's an impressive 25 meters wide and 60 meters tall.

If you've taken your time seeing all the beautiful sites, light is probably fading by now, but there is a Bistro Bar nearby Skógafoss and the recommended **Guesthouse Rauðafell** is just a short drive away in **Hvolsvöllur**. The guest house is large modern and spotless and has 6 rooms for guests. There is also a breakfast provided in the morning.

## Day 2
### Hvolsvöllur to Hofn

![alt text][reynisfjara]

**Things to see**
 - Dyrhólaey
 - Reynisfjara
 - Skaftareldahraun
 - Pjadrurfoss
 - Vatnajökull
 - Skaftafell
 - Diamond Beach 

 **Where to stay**
 - Höfn í Hornafirði, Höfn (AirBnB)

After what will be a lovely breakfast, set out for **Dyrhólaey**, which is a mountain peninsula on a cliff with some staggering views. There is an impressive looking rock arch standing strong in the sea and a black beach down below. In the summer you can see puffins here. 

There is a plane wreck on the route before Dyrhólaey called **DC-3 Plane Wreckage**, which crashed in 1973. The fusalage was abandoned there afterwards. It's a 4km hike over very dull black sand terrain (or you can take a expensive shuttle bus), so I didn't venture out to see it, but it could be a good photo opportunity.

The next stop is **Reynisfjara**, near the town of Vik. Stop here for a while an appreciate the black sand, the crashing waves and the basalt columns and rock formations. It's a truly spectacular place and if you're a city dweller it's a great chance to unwind and feel relaxed.

After taking it the atmosphere of Reynisfjara, you'll drive to Vatnajökull National park which as some great hiking routes and a tour up the biggset glacier in Iceland. 

However before that you'll go through the **Skaftareldahraun moss lava fields**, there isn't too much to see here but the bleak desolate landscape can really strike home - there is ancient black lava covered in moss as far as the eye can see. 

There are also some great stops along the way, the main one of note is **Pjadrurfoss waterfall**. It's a small waterfall but the setting and the several streams of water all frothing and flowing into the main river is magnificent. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/pjadrurfoss.jpg' alt='Pjadrurfoss waterfall' caption='Pjadrurfoss waterfall' %}

The main attraction of the afternoon is **Vatnajökull National Park**, which is named after the biggest glacier in Iceland. It's about the size of Cyprus and  and the national park has guided tours up the glacier. You can't go on your own so you'll need a guide, which will supply the correct equipment to walk up this magnificant glacier. 

If you fancy something a bit more low-key, there are great hiking trails around the **Skaftafell** area of the national park, and you are also only about a 20 minute walk from a magnificant lake near Vatnajökull glacier, which has small icebergs floating in it, making for some fantastic scenery. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/vatnajokull.jpg' alt='Vatnajökull National Park' caption='Vatnajökull National Park' %}

Once you've had your fill of the Vatnajökull National Park, hopefully you have enough day light to admire the **Diamond Beach** (I didn't unfortunately!). It's an incredibly picturesque beach where the icebergs of Jökulsárlón wash up on their journey out to the Atlantic Ocean, giving a stark contrast to the jet black sand. 

A short drive later and you'll make it to the small fishing village of Hofn to your accomodation. 

## Day 3

### Hofn to Egilsstaðir

![alt text][stokksnes]

**Things to see**
 - Hoffell hot tubs
 - Stokksnes Mountain
 - The Viking Village
 - Lagarfljót

 **Where to stay**
 - Tehúsið Hostel, Egilsstaðir (AirBnB)

Good morning! Hope you had a good sleep because you have a busy day ahead of  you. First up is the **Hoffell Hot Tubs**. Now, just to manage your expectations here, don't expect Blue Lagoon style luxury, these are hot tubs that it feels like locals would use, but the facilities are clean, it's very cheap and it is set in a beautiful location. 

There are about 5 hot hubs, all geothermally heated and changing rooms, an outdoor shower and towels are provided. It's definitely worth a visit. 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/hoffell-hot-tub.jpg' alt='Hoffell Hot Tubs' caption='Hoffell Hot Tubs' %}

Next up is a drive to the **Stokksnes mountain** area, which is a beautiful area on a peninsula. You'll have to pay a little in the Viking Cafe t oget through the barriers and to the car park but once you do, you can wonder around a very picturesque area with the mountain looming over another black beach. 

A little walk inland you'll come to the **Viking Village**, which is a intricate and accurately build viking village for a TV series that never made it to air. The remains of the village are still here and it really is an experience to wonder around and feel how vikings could have once lived. You may notice the strange remains of a fake rock wall near the center of the village, this was to hide a stone building from view. The stairs are still accessible from the back so go ahead, climb them and explore! 

{% include image.html url='/assets/iceland/viking-village.jpg' alt='Viking Village' caption='Viking Village' %}

There is quite a long drive to Egilsstaðir, the largest city in the East, but on the way you'll come across **Lagarfljót**, which is a large lake. According to legend the lake is said to hold the cousin of the Loch Ness monster, the Lagarfljót Wyrm. Sightings to back to 1345, so see if you can spot it. 

From here you'll be pretty close to **Egilsstaðir**, the Capital of the East. You'll be staying at **Tehúsið Hostel**, which is a great hostel with a bar (happy hour til 7pm!), games and a great chill out area. It's also worth a wonder into town too to check out the Askur Taproom, which has a wide range of craft beers and karaoke. This bar wouldn't be out of place in Shoreditch, London!
