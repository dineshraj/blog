So you've made it to Iceland and you're staying for 8 days. This is a guide to help
you on that journey so you get to see the best spots and also have some great places to stay. 

You've probably arrived at Keflavík International Airport, taken the shuttle bus to pick up your car and
are itching with excitement to explore this beautiful island! 

We'll start you off just leaving the capital, Reykjavik (don't worry, you'll spend some time there at the end!)
and point out the best things to see and some great places to stay too. 

Don't just stick to these places though, take lots of unscheduled stops and the various laybys on the ring road, there is so much beautiful scenery between these places so don't miss out on those!

(Note: Most guides will tell you to visit the Blue Lagoon first but due to a delayed flight, that didn't happen in this trip. I hear it's beautiful but very expensive).

Ok, let's get started!
