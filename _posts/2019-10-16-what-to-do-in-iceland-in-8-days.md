So you've made it to Iceland and you're staying for 8 days. This is a guide to help
you on that journey so you get to see the best spots and also have some great places to stay. 

You've probably arrived at Keflavík International Airport, taken the shuttle bus to pick up your car and
are itching with excitement to explore this beautiful island! 

We'll start you off just leaving the capital, Reykjavik (don't worry, you'll spend some time there at the end!)
and point out the best things to see and some great places to stay too. 

Don't just stick to these places though, take lots of unscheduled stops and the various laybys on the ring road, there is so much beautiful scenery between these places so don't miss out on those!

(Note: Most guides will tell you to visit the Blue Lagoon first but due to a delayed flight, that didn't happen on this trip. I hear it's beautiful but very expensive).

This article will start with a overview and then it'll go into more detail. Ok, let's get started!

***Note on the weather**: Unfortunately the weather was not ideal during the entire duration of the trip, and apart from a couple of days it was constantly cloudy and rainy, with not a clear night at all. This meant we could not see any stars or the nothern lights, whether this is typical for October or not, I'm not sure*

<!-- 
  Notes 
    - set out pretty early, went to the rift which connects two tectonic plates (North
    American and Eurasian). The rift itself is 7km wide and it grows a bit each year as the plates move apart
    so Iceland is technically getting bigger. It also sinks 2cm a year due to this too
