![Millie's style cookie recipe][intro]

This simple recipe will give you lovely soft chewy cookies, similar to Millie's cookies (who do amazing cookies if you've never tried them!). The guide baking time is 8 minutes, but you can bake them between 7-10 mins if you prefer them a bit softer or harder.

## Ingredients
* **125g**	Unsalted Butter (room temp)
* **115g**	Golden Granulated/Caster Sugar
* **110g**	White Granulated/Caster Sugar
* **1**	Medium Egg
* **1 tsp**	Vanilla Extract 
* **220g**	Self Raising Flour
  * If you do not have self raising flour, mix 2 tsp baking powder to each 150g of flour, this will be just under **3 tsp** (roughly 12g) of baking powder
* **1/2 tsp**	Salt
* **200g**	Chopped chocolate (or chocolate chips)
  * Any chocolate will do, this recipe was done twice, once with white chocolate and once with dark chocolate

## Equipment
* Two bowls
* Electric whisk (a hand wisk can work but it will be harder)
* Spatula
* Baking trays 
  * Ideally 4 if you have room, or make the cookies two trays at a time
* Greaseproof paper
* Sieve 

## Instructions
* Preheat the oven to 200°C, (fan 180°C, gas mark 4) and line your baking trays with greaseproof paper.

* Whisk the butter and sugars together until the mixture is fluffy and pale.

* add the egg and vanilla extract and whisk the mixture until mixed together.

* Sift the flour and salt (and baking powder if applicable) into a separate bowl and then add to the mixture a little bit at a time, whisking as you go (this avoids it going everywhere!). A soft dough will form.

* Stir in the chocolate with a spatula, making sure they are evenly distributed (have a taste, cookie dough is delicious!).

* Make small balls of cookie dough and put them in the lined baking trays. Leave a lot of space between them as they will spread when they bake. About 6 per medium sized tray is recommended. 

* Put the baking trays in the oven and bake for 8 minutes, remember you can bake from 7 to 10 minutes depending on the texture you prefer.

{% include important.html text='<strong>Note:</strong> When removed from the oven, the cookies will come out looking uncooked and unset, this is normal and they will harden as they cool'  %}
