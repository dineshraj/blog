![Quick fudge recipe ][intro]

This is a really quick and simple fudge recipe, which I got from [Cupcake Jemma's Cookies & Cream Fudge Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVw23vxNiiA). Unlike "real" fudge, this involves minimal effort but with great end results.

## Equipment
* A bowl
* A saucepan (which the bowl can rest on without touching the bottom)

### Cookies and Cream layer

* Chop up the white chocolate into small chunks and put in your bowl.

* Pour in your condensed milk and vanilla extract.

* Boil some water and pour into your saucepan, so there is an inch of water at the bottom, keep it simmering. 

* Put your bowl on top of the pan, making sure that the bottom of the bowl isn't touching the water (you'll use the steam to heat up your ingredients)
  * Congratulations you've just made a [Bain-marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie)

* Stir the mixture until the ingredients are well incorporated, you'll know this by the mixture holding together and no longer leaving sticky traces on the side of the bowl.

* Take the bowl off the pan and mix in your broken up Oreos. Do this quickly as the mixture will start to set!

* Now (equally quickly) pour your mixture into your baking tray and spread it around until the surface is smooth (a back of a spoon will do if you don't have anything fancier).

* Leave it to set in the fridge for 1 hour.

### Chocolate layer

* Get your Cookie and cream layer out of the fridge and set it nearby. 

* Chop up the dark chocolate into small chunks and put in your bowl.

* Chop up your butter and put in bowl with the chocolate. 

* Add vanilla extract and salt

* Reconstruct your Bain-marie and heat up the mixture, mixing it well as it heats.

* When it is fully incorporated, take it off the heat and mix in the condensed milk.

* Pour the mixture over the cookies and cream layer and smooth out the surface as before.
  * Don't worry if some drips down the sides, you'll trim the sides later on to make everything more pretty!

* Put in the fridge for another hour

### Serving

* Take the fudge out of fridge
* Trim the sides to make it looks nice.
