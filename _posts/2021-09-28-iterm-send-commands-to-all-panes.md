![iterm][intro]

I use iTerm2 as a my termimal of choice on my mac (along with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)). 

There are times when I have multiple iTerm2 panes on one window and I want to send commands to all of them. This is especially useful when updating npm packages across several apps, especially if you have a microservice architecture.

To do this on a Mac, the shortcut is  `cmd + shift + I`

If you want to get out of this state (this is something that was hard to find online), the shortcut is `cmd + opt + shift + I`
